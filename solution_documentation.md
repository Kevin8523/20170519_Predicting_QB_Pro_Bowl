# Solutions Guide
Notes on the work done, papers read, and attempts to the final solution

## Main Concepts

### What do I expect to see?
- Small number of successfull QBs, on average I would guess 2 good quarterbacks per year

### What do expert see?
- Drafting a QB is very difficult, how can a team minimize risk?
	+ Possible to draft in the later rounds to get a potential franchise QB?
- Likes: good frame, strong arm, accurate quarterback, played in pro system


## Exploratory Data Analysis
What would a GM would want to see and know to find interesting takeaways
- ~~Conference vs probowl: Count & Color == DONE~~
- ~~Year vs probowl == DONE~~
- ~~Accuracy vs probowl == DONE~~
- ~~height vs probowl == DONE~~
- pca vs probowl (Could try accuracy with other features) == WIP
- rounds drafted vs probowl
- Common themes of 1st round busts
- Where are most of the busts coming from
- Common theme among pro bowl Qbs

## Feature Engineering Ideas
- Physical Traits
- Offense type
- Defense faced

## Challenged Faced 
- Predicting probowl quarterbacks
- Ranking QBs

## Solutions
- PCA
	+ Upsampled data
	+ Use the training data to predict
- Could try upsampling data
- Try ranking the players maybe do a regression
